# TikTok Influencer Brand Analysis Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing the brand performance of TikTok influencer **Lee Chatmen**, renowned for his humorous videos featuring popular songs played on miniature guitars. In 2023, he launched his own merchandise line, and this dashboard provides insights into how his brand is performing.

## Dashboard Insights

The dashboard answers the following key questions:

1. What are the overall sales trends?
2. Which product category performs the best?
3. What are the most and least popular products?
4. How does location affect sales performance?
5. What impact does international shipping have on sales?
6. What is the demographic profile of buyers?
7. How do ratings and reviews correlate with sales?
8. What are the trends in shipping charges?
9. How do discounts influence purchasing behavior?
10. Are there any patterns in repeat purchases?

## Key Insights

1. Sales remain consistent throughout the year, with **May** being the peak month, generating a total of **$856k** in sales.
2. The **clothing** category was the most popular, accounting for over **70%** of total revenue, while the **other** category accounted for only **7.4%** of sales.
3. **Sydney** generated the highest revenue at **$48k**, while **Montreal** had the lowest at **$26k**.
4. **Males** accounted for the majority of buyers, generating over **$320k**, compared to **$274k** from females.
5. Domestic customers made up **55.8%** of sales, while international customers accounted for **45%**. This difference is largely due to shipping fees; domestic customers pay no shipping fees, whereas international customers do, which tends to decrease sales as shipping costs rise.
6. Products with lower ratings correlated with reduced sales, highlighting the impact of customer sentiment.
7. The **18-22 age group** is associated with higher purchasing activity.
8. The product **BF1548** was the top seller, generating over **$190k** in sales.
